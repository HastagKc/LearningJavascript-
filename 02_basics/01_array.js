*Shallow Copy:*
Making a shallow copy of an object is like copying a list of items by referencing them. Changes to one item affect both the original and the copy because they share the same references.

*Deep Copy:*
Creating a deep copy involves making a new set of items with the same names. Changes to one item do not affect the other because they are independent copies.
